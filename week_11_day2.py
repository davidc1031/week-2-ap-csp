# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Marvin"
age = 30
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
Print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))


# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"My name is (first_name) and my favorite color is (fav_color)")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
fav_color = "yellow"
number_2 = 3
fav3 = int(fav_color) + int(number_2)
print(f"my favorite number is plus 3 is(fav3)")

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
number1 = int(input("What is your favorite number?:"))
number2 = int(input("What is your 2nd favorite number?:"))
number3 = number1 + number2
print(f"your favorite number plus your favorite number is (number3)")




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
Fav_word = input("what is your fav word?")
Fav_word2 = input("what is your 2nd fav word?")
numberofletters = int(len{fav_word}) + int(len{fav_word2})
